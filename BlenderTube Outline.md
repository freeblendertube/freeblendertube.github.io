[A] What is BlenderTube?

[A1] BlenderTube is a portal with access to many high-value Blender videos and tutorials. Each video post provides a scrubbable sprite that gives an overall vibe of the video. This can be a great way to figure out if a particular video will be helpful in teaching you what you want to do. It's also just good eye-candy to be able to quickly sample from various types of Blender tutorials. We hope this can be a useful tool for anyone that does 3d.

[A2] There are many more features to come to BlenderTube, so stay tuned.

## Lists

Unordered

+ Create a list by starting a line with `+`, `-`, or `*`
+ Sub-lists are made by indenting 2 spaces:
  - Marker character change forces new list start:
    * Ac tristique libero volutpat at
    + Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet
    - Nulla volutpat aliquam velit
+ Very easy!

Ordered

1. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
2. Consectetur adipiscing elit
3. Integer molestie lorem at massa


1. You can use sequential numbers...
1. ...or keep all the numbers as `1.`

Start numbering with offset:

57. foo
1. bar
